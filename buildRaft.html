        <p class="paragraph">You promptly put together a raft with some pieces of driftwood you found near the crash site. To your amazement, it seems to float. With great joy, you get into the raft and manage to make it good 20 feet into deep water before it springs a leak. You continue for another 10 feet before it falls apart entirely leaving you to drown in the middle of the ocean. You try to make it back but are too exhausted and you drown.</p>
